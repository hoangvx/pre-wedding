Nếu đã Theo dõi những bài trước chắc hẳn mọi người cũng đã biết chúng tôi có tính cách và sở thích khác biệt nhau như thế nào. Nói về vấn đề này thì phải gọi là viết mấy trang giấy cũng không thể hết được, nên đơn cử một vài thứ cho mọi người dễ hình dung về chúng tôi thôi. Món ăn mà lần đầu tiên tôi được người yêu tôi nấu cho là món “cà ri” các bạn ạ, là món “cà ri” nhé. �Người yêu tôi nói về khoản tâm lý thì nếu xếp thứ nhì thì chắc chắn không ai dám đứng thứ nhất - từ dưới lên trên. Chính vì thế mà anh ấy đã chọn “cà ri“ là món mà tôi ghét gần nhất vào thời điểm đó để nấu cho tôi ăn. Ừ thì vì đánh giá cao năng lực của một chàng trai không biết nấu ăn là gì muốn thể hiện mình trước mặt bạn gái nên tôi cũng tạo điều kiện để có cơ hội trổ tài, thực sự là cũng không nhớ hương vị của nó như thế nào nhưng thời điểm đó tôi đánh giá là không tệ, và nồi cà ri hình như cũng được chị em bạn dì trong phòng xử lý hết. Thật ra cả những món sau này người yêu tôi nấu cho tôi ăn thì đều là những món mà ổng thích ăn chứ chẳng cần biết là tôi có thích ăn hay không - hay nói thẳng thừng ra là những món tôi ghét hay không, duyên thế nào toàn những món tôi ghét không thứ nhất thì cũng thứ hai, thứ ba...
## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

- This however showed weasel
- Well uncritical so misled
  - this is very interesting
- Goodness much until that fluid owl

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

#### Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in
which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin

This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
